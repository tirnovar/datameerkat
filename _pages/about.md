I am a data lover, especially in the ecosystem of Microsoft tools. I primarily focus on Power BI, Azure Synapse and Azure SQL. In general, I follow a very simple motto.

> Don't say something cannot be done, or someone who doesn't know will come and do it.

I am one of the founders of a company called DataBrothers, and I am currently in the position of Lead Technical Consultant. Where we help companies with Power BI and train all kinds of users and developers around the world.

I am also a member of the [Czech and Slovak Power Platform User Group (#czskppug)](https://www.meetup.com/czskppug/), where I am responsible for the organization of the group meetups and the organization of the annual [Power Platform Conference in Prague](https://www.powerconference.cz/).

I am delighted to go outside the borders of the Czech Republic to conferences, both from the point of view of a participant and from the point of view of a speaker. You can usually find out where I will be participating from my [sessionize account](https://sessionize.com/stepan-resl/).

Also, in addition to articles here and on LinkedIn, I contribute to various Open-Source projects on GitHub and create my own. Among such smaller projects are the [Power BI REST API custom Power BI connector](https://github.com/tirnovar/Power-BI-Admin-REST-API-Connector) or [collection of Power Query functions to download data from that API](https://github.com/tirnovar/Power_BI_REST_API_PQ) and my personal collection of [custom Power Query functions](https://github.com/tirnovar/m-custom-functions).
