I am a data lover, especially in the ecosystem of Microsoft tools. I primarily focus on Power BI, Azure Synapse and Azure SQL. In general, I follow a very simple motto.

> Don´t say it cannot be done, or someone who doesn´t know it will come and do it.

I am a co-founder and a Lead Technical Consultant at DataBrothers. We are Power BI experts and consultants with a focus on data analysis, reporting, and training in Power BI. We work with our clients across the globe on developing custom solutions and training their users on all levels (from business to development). We also developed a self-learning application [ReporTee](https://reportee.cz/en/) for end-users.

I engage in a lot of community work and activities and organize meetups of the [Czech and Slovak Power Platform User Group (#czskppug)](https://www.meetup.com/czskppug/) or the annual [Power Platform Conference](https://www.powerconference.cz/) we started last year.

I also love the adventures of attending conferences abroad both as a speaker and a participant. You can see my planned „gigs“ on my [sessionize account](https://sessionize.com/stepan-resl/).

In addition to sharing articles on this new site and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%A1t%C4%9Bp%C3%A1n-re%C5%A1l-464084152/), I contribute to various Open-Source projects on GitHub and create my own such as the [Power BI REST API custom Power BI connector](https://github.com/tirnovar/Power-BI-Admin-REST-API-Connector), [collection of Power Query functions to download data from that API](https://github.com/tirnovar/Power_BI_REST_API_PQ), and my personal collection of [custom Power Query functions](https://github.com/tirnovar/m-custom-functions).
