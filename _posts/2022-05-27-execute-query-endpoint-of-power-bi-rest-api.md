title: Why Should I Be Interested in the ExecuteQueries Endpoint of PBI REST API? # title of the post
description: At the end of last year, one called ExecuteQueries was added to the endpoint portfolio in the Power BI REST API. It is an endpoint that allows you to extract data directly from datasets. Although it also brings limitations, I think that its advantages outweigh them. So what can it be used for, and why should I be interested? # will be shown as a description in the post list
